The Three Science Ships Into the Future

1. Open Science Risk Assessment Council (OSRAC)

2. Open Science Model Forum (OSMF)

3. Open Science Leverage Forum (OSLF)

Three science disorganizations dedicated to:

Dedicated to achieve science outcomes without politicking.

Remain independent of any external organization's or cause that is tangential to the goals.

Concentrating on:

Open Proceedings

Open Participation

Open Access

Free Association

A Simpler way to look at them:

FINDER  OSRAC

To present, estimate, and assess new risks based on open mathematical models, and accompanying predictions, warning indicators, and potential solution vectors.

Open Science Model Forum (OSMF)

To assemble, develop, manage, and present by loose association a myriad of scientific models (math) to science communities, government, and mankind. 

Open Science Leverage Forum (OSLF)

To provide a non-affiliated nexus for science interface to make stakeholders aware, and accelerate science leverages along and across science models.
